{"_id": "70490", "title": "Simplifying likelihood ratios", "text": "Likelihood ratios are one of the best measures of diagnostic accuracy, although they are seldom used, because interpreting them requires a calculator to convert back and forth between \u201cprobability\u201d and \u201codds\u201d of disease. This article describes a simpler method of interpreting likelihood ratios, one that avoids calculators, nomograms, and conversions to \u201codds\u201d of disease. Several examples illustrate how the clinician can use this method to refine diagnostic decisions at the bedside.", "metadata": {}}
{"_id": "102662", "title": "A rapid method for extraction of cotton (Gossypium spp.) genomic DNA suitable for RFLP or PCR analysis", "text": "Extraction of high-quality genomic DNA fromGossypium (cotton) species is difficult due to high levels of polysaccharide, oxidizable quinones, and other interfering substances. We describe a procedure that consistently permits isolation of cotton genomic DNA of satisfactory size and quality for RFLP and PCR analysis, as well as for most routine cloning applications. Several antioxidants, phenol-binding reagents, and phenol oxidase inhibitors are used throughout the procedure, and most polysaccharides are eliminated early in the procedure by isolation of nuclei.", "metadata": {}}
